     * with different alignment within a byte.

     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
     * 
     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
     *    first.
     * 
     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
     * 
     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
     * 
     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
     * 
     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.
